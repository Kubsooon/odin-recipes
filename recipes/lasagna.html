    <h1>Baked Ziti and Lasagna inspired by The Sopranos</h1>
    <img src="assets/lasagna-photo.png" a="Lasagna baked" width="800">
    <p>Rarely does food play such a central character in a TV show or movie that's not specifically about food, 
        but in The Sopranos, it might as well be one of the family.</p> 
        <p>The crown jewel of which, despite Artie Bucco's hapless attempts, is the cuisine of Carmela Soprano.
        Strap on your gold President and build a ramp for the ducks,</p>
        <p>because it's time to emotionally repress our murderous mentality with some cheesy,
        saucy pasta - with a layer of basil underneath the cheese, of course.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves crushed garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
        <li>1 pound sweet italian sausage (casing removed) </li>
        <li>Tomato paste (1-2 Tbsp)</li>
        <li>(4) 28oz cans San Marzano tomatoes (lightly crushed)</li>
        <li>1 parmesan cheese rind</li>
        <li>1 whole stem basil</li>
        <li>Chopped basil, to taste</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a dutch oven, give a generous pour of extra virgin olive oil and bring to a simmer over medium heat. </li>
        <li>Add 1 large chopped onion and stir until soft and translucent. </li>
        <li>Add 6 cloves of crushed garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Next, set aside your onion and garlic and cook your beef and sausage in batches until it is brown and crumbly.</li>
        <li>Drain off most of the fat and add the garlic and onion back into the pot. Then, add a few tablespoons of tomato paste. </li>
        <li>Add (4) 28oz cans of San Marzano tomatoes (lightly crushed) to the pot. Stir to combine. </li>
        <li>For moisture, fill one of your tomato cans with water and add to the pot. </li>
        <li>Add 1 parmesan cheese rind as well as 1 whole stem of basil to the pot. Cover the pot and bring to a simmer. </li>
        <li>Once the sauce is bubbling, stir and partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to about as low as your stove will go. Simmer for 1 ½ hours, keep the sauce   
            bubbling, and stir occasionally.  </li>
        <li>Add some chopped basil to the pot and season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and set aside the sauce for later recipes.</li>
    </ol>
